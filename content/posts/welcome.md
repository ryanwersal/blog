Welcome! I've decided to start this blog as a way to document my journey through the fascinating (and sometimes bewildering) world of AI and technology.

The plan? Write something every day - or at least that's the goal! These posts will mostly be quick thoughts, discoveries, and "aha!" moments as I dive deeper into:

- AI/ML developments (because let's face it, this field moves at lightning speed)
- Interesting tech I'm playing with
- Things I'm learning along the way

Why daily? Hopefully writing here will help me process what I'm learning - and maybe it'll help you too!

Don't expect long, formal essays here. Think of this more like a public learning journal with a dash of "hey, check out this cool thing I found!" mixed in with some "wow, I totally didn't expect that to work/break that way!"

So, stick around if you're interested in:
- Following along with someone learning their way through the vast AI landscape
- Getting regular, bite-sized updates about AI and tech
- Seeing both the "this is amazing!" and the "well, that didn't work" moments

Let's see where this goes!
