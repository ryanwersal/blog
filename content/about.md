# About This Blog

This is where I document my exploration of programming and technology (and most acutely: AI). The focus is on quick, regular updates about what I'm learning and building.

## About Me

I'm Ryan, a software engineer diving deep into the AI space. I'm particularly interested in how AI is reshaping the way we build and interact with technology.

## Why This Blog?

I trying out learning in public. This blog serves to:
- Document my journey through AI and tech
- Share practical insights and discoveries
- Keep a record of both successes and learning moments
- Maybe help others on similar paths
