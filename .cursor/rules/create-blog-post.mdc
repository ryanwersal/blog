# Creating a New Blog Post

Use the `hugo` CLI to create new posts: `hugo new content/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- Replace YYYY-MM-DD with the date of the post.
- If the post is for today, use `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` to determine today's date.
- Choose a pithy title but keep it short.
- The title in the filename should be a lowercased and hyphenated version of the blog post title (minus emoji).

Seed the blog post with:
- Start the title with a suitable emoji for the topic.
- Add 2-5 suitable tags to the frontmatter section.

Provide a 2-4 bullet points about the topic. Do NOT write the blog post or any prose.
