# Creating a New Blog Post

## Title and Filename
- Start the title with an appropriate emoji followed by a space
- The filename (without extension) must match the title when converted to lowercase with spaces replaced by hyphens
- Example: If title is "ðŸš€ My Great Post", filename should be "my-great-post.md"
- Files starting with underscore (_) are exempt from these rules

## Date and Time
Use the following command to generate the correct date format:
```bash
date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
```
- The date must be today's date (future dates are not allowed)
- Always use UTC (indicated by the Z suffix)
- Example output: 2024-04-29T14:30:00Z

## Frontmatter Template
```yaml
---
title: "ðŸš€ Your Post Title"
date: 2024-04-29T14:30:00Z
---
```

## Best Practices
1. Choose an emoji that represents the content of your post
2. Keep filenames short but descriptive
3. Use the CLI command to ensure correct date formatting
4. Double-check that the filename matches the title format
